Hi

This is an example map script for ICB data linked to some random data for mapping ICBs, to create a leaflet map for comparing NHS systems. 

Simple features;
- labeling areas, currently with system name
- a button to go full screen
- output to an RMarkdown HTML to make it easy to share via email etc.
- could easily filter for region etc.

I've experimented with labelling maps etc, and use data from the UK Geoportal.

Feedback and improvements welcome, probably using too many libraries in this example, as code originally also had point data overlayed for providers.
