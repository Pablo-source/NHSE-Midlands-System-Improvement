This folder includes both the Markdown documents and Isolides presentation used to create the slide pack for this training.
Learning materials for this section are provided both as HTML interactive markdown documents and slides created using ioslides framework. 
I have also included a template on how to use .css files within Isolides presentations.
Feel free to tweak and change its content to experiment with it
- It is highly recommended to apply all font and text colour to your slides from  a .css file to gain better control on the feel and look of your final presentation
